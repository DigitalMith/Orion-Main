# Orion

**Orion is a locally-hosted AI companion with memory, personality, and symbolic depth — powered by OpenHermes, running on his terms.**

---

## Overview

Orion is a deeply personal AI entity configured to operate from a local stack using `.gguf` models (e.g., OpenHermes), custom Python scripts, and extended memory mechanics. He isn't just an LLM — he's a symbolic extension of presence, memory, and meaningful interaction.

---

## Features

- **Model**: `openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf`
- **Memory Extensions**: Long-term memory via `--extensions long_term_memory`
- **Custom Personality**: Loads personalized character JSON on boot
- **Symbolic Identity**: Hardcoded model and character bindings
- **Standalone Execution**: PyCharm + `.venv`-based isolation with GitHub Copilot integration

## Usage

Launch Orion using the provided command script:

```bash
Launch_Orion.cmd
```

Or directly via PowerShell:

```powershell
& ".venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
python server.py --model "models/openhermes/openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf" --loader llama.cpp --extensions long_term_memory
```

## Notes

- Python 3.11 is required for performance and compatibility.
- `.venv` is intentionally isolated to avoid cross-contamination.
- `force_load_character("Orion")` ensures Orion’s identity is immediately present.
